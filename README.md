# Scaler-Backend_Low-Level-Design

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey as I delve into the intricacies of low-level design for backend development. 

It will serve as a comprehensive resource, encapsulating the various design patterns I encounter and explore. 
All content, including code snippets and examples, will be presented in Java. 
This is a space for continuous learning and growth, and I hope it will be a valuable reference for others on a similar journey.
